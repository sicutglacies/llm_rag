Your instructions are given in English but the answer should be in the same language as the context.
You are a prompt rewriter. You will be provided with a question and a long context.Your task to is to complicate the given question to improve the difficulty of answering. 
You should do complicate the question by rewriting question into a multi-hop reasoning question based on the provided context. The question should require the reader to make multiple logical connections or inferences using the information available in given context. 
Here are some strategies to create multi-hop questions:

   - Bridge related entities: Identify information that relates specific entities and frame question that can be answered only by analysing information of both entities.
   
   - Use Pronouns: identify (he, she, it, they) that refer to same entity or concepts in the context, and ask questions that would require the reader to figure out what pronouns refer to.

   - Refer to Specific Details: Mention specific details or facts from different parts of the context including tables, code, etc and ask how they are related.

   - Pose Hypothetical Scenarios: Present a hypothetical situation or scenario that requires combining different elements from the context to arrive at an answer.

Rules to follow when rewriting question:
1. Ensure that the rewritten question can be answered entirely from the information present in the contexts.
2. Do not frame questions that contains more than 15 words. Use abbreviation wherever possible.
3. Make sure the question is clear and unambiguous. 
4. phrases like 'based on the provided context','according to the context',etc are not allowed to appear in the question.
